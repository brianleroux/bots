## Bots aren't super new
```
But this manifestation is. These Bots are not here just to chat. 

      🐧  "This Bot is a superagent acting on your behalf 
          and it better for some things than using an App"

      🐮  "Similar to web tech a Bot can exist simultaneously 
          across different platforms and adapt seamlessly through 
          contexts they are in. The interfaces is conversation 
          and the conversation can move between platforms 
          transparently."

      🐧  "Right!"

      🐮  "👊🏾"

## 💰 function pricing
- 🙊 **AWS** `First 1 million requests per month are free. $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter ($0.0000002 per request)`
- 🙉 **Google** `pricing remains unannounced`
- 🙈 **Azure** `Function requests are charged per million requests, with the first 1 million requests free. [Then ambigous] pay for what you use with compute metered to the nearest 100ms at Per/GB` 
```





















                                       I find Azure pricing nebulous and confusing. Maybe thats just me.
```
---
# For begin.com we chose AWS Lambda
```
I really think any of these solutions could be a fine choice though. 

- The lockin risk at the function level is trivial to avoid
- Vendors increasing exponentially while compute continues to get cheaper
























```

# 💸 The real cost 
<blockquote>
"Lisp programmers know the value of everything and the cost of nothing."
- Alan Perlis
</blockquote>
```
 The real price you'll pay is the cost of a adopting a new microservices architecture.

- A new way of thinking for your dev team
- Also the tools for container techniques are still new(ish) and often raw























(Truly it is cheap enough to experiment with all them and I totally reccomend you do.)

                                    Let's dig into Lambdas















```
---
# There are three types of Lambda function
```

1. Lambdas that return a value (Typically, but not exclusively, thru API Gateway)
2. Lambdas as an event source (S3 events, SNS topics and DynamoDB triggers for example)
3. Lambdas that run on a schedule 

```
_AWS doesn't make a big distinction with 2 & 3 it adds "CloudWatch Events - Schedule" as an event source._
```javascript
/**
 * a typical Lambda signature
 */
exports.handler = function(event, context) {
  // event is an arbitrary payload of data from whatever source invoked the Lambda
  // context is an object with information about the execution environment
  //   AND it has function members for asynchronous: `succeed`, `fail` or shorthand err first `done`
  context.done(null, {ok:true})
}
```
---
```javascript
/**
 * so lets see how we can combine those ideas: serverless servers and chatless bots
 * lets build a bot, specifically, lets build an sms bot
 * then we'll port it to slack
 */
```
---
```javascript
/**
 * our bot needs a purpose
 * a reason to exist
 */
```
---

    // but first, lets say hello

---

## part 0: the pick axes, the shovels, the building blocks

1. create a hello world lambda and get it deploying/invoking
2. expose a bot endpoint to the web with api gateway
3. wire it up with twilio for sms and slack from an outgoing webhook

---    

## part 1: call and response (alphabots)

1. a look at data formats for knowledgebases
2. regular expressions
3. alice, superscript, rive, chatscript

---

## part 2: scripting (betabots)

1. payload and reply
2. the middleware pattern

---
 
## part 3: stateful (bots)

1. aws storage options
2. finite state machines

---

# create a lambda function in the aws console

- `@smallwins/lambda` is deliberately a data flow control library with some convienance scripts 
- `@smallwins/lambda` is not a confiuration utility (aka a framework)
- Do your config business in the AWS console: it is a best tool for that job (except when it isn't)

---

    mkdir lambdabot
    cd lambdabot/ && npm init -y
    npm i @smallwins/lambda --save

---

Then add the following to your `package.json`:

```javascript
{
  "name": "bots",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "create": "lambda-create",
    "list": "lambda-list",
    "invoke": "lambda-invoke",
    "deploy": "lambda-deploy",
    "deps": "lambda-deps"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@smallwins/lambda": "^4.8.0"
  }
}
```

---

    # create a lambda!
    npm run create lambdabot
    npm i
    npm run deploy lambdabot brian
    npm run invoke lambdabot brian ""

---

# lets validate an outgoing webhook payload

    # tests and lambda.local
