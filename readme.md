## Bots aren't super new
```
But this manifestation is. These Bots are not here just to chat. 

      🐧  "This Bot is a superagent acting on your behalf 
          and it better for some things than using an App"

      🐮  "Similar to web tech a Bot can exist simultaneously 
          across different platforms and adapt seamlessly through 
          contexts they are in. The interfaces is conversation 
          and the conversation can move between platforms 
          transparently."

      🐧  "Right!"

      🐮  "👊🏾"

## 💰 function pricing
- 🙊 **AWS** `First 1 million requests per month are free. $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter ($0.0000002 per request)`
- 🙉 **Google** `pricing remains unannounced`
- 🙈 **Azure** `Function requests are charged per million requests, with the first 1 million requests free. [Then ambigous] pay for what you use with compute metered to the nearest 100ms at Per/GB` 
```





















                                       I find Azure pricing nebulous and confusing. Maybe thats just me.
```
---
# For begin.com we chose AWS Lambda
```
I really think any of these solutions could be a fine choice though. 

- The lockin risk at the function level is trivial to avoid
- Vendors increasing exponentially while compute continues to get cheaper
























```

# 💸 The real cost 
<blockquote>
"Lisp programmers know the value of everything and the cost of nothing."
- Alan Perlis ripping off Oscar Wilde
</blockquote>
```
The real price you'll pay is the cost of a adopting a new microservice style architecture.

👉 A new way of thinking for your dev team
👉 Also the tools for container techniques are still new(ish) and often raw
👉 Many repos that produce even smaller deployment artifacts makes dep mgmt tricky
👉 Many repos can also make deployment tricky (to mitigate automate everything from day zero)





















(Truly it is cheap enough to experiment with all them and I totally reccomend you do.)

   | 2. 📘 Lambdas as an event source (S3 events, SNS topics and DynamoDB triggers)       |
   | 3. 📙 Lambdas that run on a schedule                                                 |

                                        ( 'CloudWatch Events - Schedule' is an event source             )

### :satellite::satellite: a lambda that returns a value :mailbox:
Here is a vanilla AWS Lambda example for performing a sum. Given `event.query.x = 1` it will return `{count:2}`.
```javascript

exports.handler = function sum(event, context) {
  var errors = []
  if (typeof event.query === 'undefined') {
    errors.push(ReferenceError('missing event.query'))
  }
  if (event.query && typeof event.query != 'object') {
    errors.push(TypeError('event.query not an object'))
  }
  if (typeof event.query.x === 'undefined') {
    errors.push(ReferenceError('event.query not an object'))
  }
  if (event.query.x && typeof event.query.x != 'number') {
    errors.push(TypeError('event.query not an object'))
  }
  if (errors.length) {
    // otherwise Error would return [{}, {}, {}, {}]
    var err = errors.map(function(e) {return e.message})
    context.fail(err) 
  }
  else {
    context.succeed({count:event.query.x + 1})
  }
}
```
<blockquote>Validating a _single variable_ `event.query.x`!! </blockquote>

```
A huge amount of vanilla AWS Lambda code is working around quirky parameter validation. API Gateway gives you control over the parameters you can expect but this still means one or more of: headers, querystring, form body, or url parameters. Event source style lambdas are not much better because you can often still get differing payloads from different origin sources. In the example above we are validating one querystring parameter x. Imagine a big payload! 😮

Worse still, writing a good program we want to use JavaScript's builtin Error but it still needs manual serialization (and you still lose the stack trace). The latter part of this vanilla code uses the funky AWS context object.

### create a lambda function in the aws console

- `@smallwins/lambda` is deliberately a data flow control library with some convienance scripts 
- `@smallwins/lambda` is not a confiuration utility (aka a framework)
- Do your config business in the AWS console: it is a best tool for that job (except when it isn't)

---

    mkdir lambdabot
    cd lambdabot/ && npm init -y
    npm i @smallwins/lambda --save

---

Then add the following to your `package.json`:

```javascript
{
  "name": "bots",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "create": "lambda-create",
    "list": "lambda-list",
    "invoke": "lambda-invoke",
    "deploy": "lambda-deploy",
    "deps": "lambda-deps"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@smallwins/lambda": "^4.8.0"
  }
}
```

---

    # create a lambda!
    npm run create lambdabot
    npm i
    npm run deploy lambdabot brian
    npm run invoke lambdabot brian ""
